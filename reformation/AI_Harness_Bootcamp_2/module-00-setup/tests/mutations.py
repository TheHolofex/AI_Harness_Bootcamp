"""Mutation corpus: proof that the oracle's checks can fail. Reference v2 section 6 C6.

Each mutation breaks the module in exactly one way and names the criterion that must
catch it. A criterion with no mutation here is unproven, and test_module_00.py fails on
that. This is DeMillo/Lipton/Sayward mutation adequacy (1978) pointed at a document set:
a check that no mutant kills is not a check.

Mutations append or create wherever possible rather than editing existing prose, so the
corpus survives ordinary revision of the module.
