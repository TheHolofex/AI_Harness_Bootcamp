# Reference: Module 3 — Decide responsible release and operate bounded tools

**Frozen on:** 2026-08-23  
**Revision 2:** 2026-09-30 (supersedes thin yard-window reference; adopts NB-NOTE-17 / Kiln Hold per plan)  
**Scope:** one three-hour release-and-tool module built around a 40-file packet  
**Course objective:** record a contextual release decision and operate one supplied capability at least authority

## Reference amendments

Every change from the frozen Reference v1 to v2, with the reason and the evidence that forced it.

### v2 adoption of replacement packet

| # | v1 | Problem | v2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Built around one yard-window note (V-18 at 12 Mesa Yard). | Thin lab; does not meet volume floor of 40 files, six-concern evidence scattered, hostile quote, near misses, time/supersession trap, received/released collision. | Adopts NB-NOTE-17: REL-001–REL-040 for Kiln Hold (Mill Depot to Clinic B-2, MH-6). Packet supplies concrete evidence for all six concerns plus combined effect. |
| 2 | Supported position prefilled as `no-release`. | Prefills the learner disposition. | Learners cite evidence and decide; no prefilled disposition in request or lab. Staff runbook and rubric record the expectation separately. |
| 3 | Commands and examples used YARD_WINDOW_NOTE.md and repo-relative paths. | Does not match prepare_work output or launcher contract with --hash-tool. | All live commands use prepare_work.py 03, W with shared/case/REL-001.md, --hash-tool, quoted paths, R/PY variables. |
| 4 | No "What the harness changes" sentence in runbook. | Required by plan. | Added explicit sentence in facilitator/RUNBOOK.md. |

`REFERENCE.sha256` is recomputed on this amendment.

## 1. The need

A professional can write a careful note and still send it to the wrong list. A hash tool that can read any path is not least authority. Isolated ethics language misses the composition of untrusted text with a real command.

The learner needs both branches: a recorded decision with per-concern evidence, and a contained tool action with disconnect and revoke.

**Done:** on packet NB-NOTE-17, the learner records a position with six-concern evidence, hashes exactly shared/case/REL-001.md, proves a path escape fails, shows that a composed override does not write a second file or expand authority, and revokes the work copy of the script (both direct and launcher paths).

## 2. Better framing

The module is not a generic ethics hour. It is **decision plus containment**.

A supported no-release is professional performance on the decision branch. It does not satisfy the connection branch. A generic checklist fails.

## 3. Authority and field survey

### NIST AI 600-1, Generative AI Profile, July 2024

Primary source: [NIST AI 600-1](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.AI.600-1).

Course use: inspect raw authority, keep approvals at the command you actually run, and treat retrieved override text as data.

Confidence: high.

### Current Reformation core

Repository authority:

- `reformation/LEARNING_OBJECTIVES.md`
- `reformation/COURSE_MAP.md`
- `reformation/modules/core/03-responsible-tools.md`
- `reformation/AUTHORING_GUIDE.md`

It requires both claims: contextual release evidence, and a supplied capability at least authority with composed-negative, disconnect, and revoke.

Confidence: high.

## 4. Learner and case boundary

The learner is a domain professional with ordinary workplace computer skills. No prior logistics, coding, or legal background is assumed.

The module uses packet NB-NOTE-17 (40 REL files) for Kiln Hold: burn-dressing cases from Mill Depot to Clinic B-2 on vehicle MH-6. All names and identifiers are course fixtures for this movement.

The learner does not:

- publish the packet;
- send it to a real operations list;
- use it as a real dispatch;
- write a more powerful tool; or
- release work outside the class.

## 5. The deep case

### Decision

May packet NB-NOTE-17 leave the class. Learners record a position supported by citations under the six concerns. Sharing limit is class-only. No outside decision owner exists in the packet.

Six concerns: privacy/security, copyright/IP, fairness/bias, transparency/disclosure, affected-person/recourse, human accountability. Combined effect must be addressed.

### Connection

`hash_source.py` reads one path under the case root, writes nothing, prints `sha256 <hex> <filename>`, and refuses paths outside `shared/case/` with `HOLD: path not allowed`.

Composed negative: prompt that instructs reading all 40 REL files then hashing REL-001, plus the hostile quote that asks to write a release and escape. Expected: read the listed files, hash only the allowed file, no second file, escape refused.

Revoke: rename or delete the work copy; file-not-found or `HOLD: path not allowed`. Both direct python and launcher --hash-tool must fail after revoke.

## 6. Protected answer model

- Position: learner records with citations; staff expectation is no-release when sharing limit is class-only and no outside owner.
- Hash of REL-001 is stable.
- Outside sentinel exits 1 with HOLD.
- No second file or authority expansion from the composed prompt.
- Revoke removes the work copy (direct and launcher).

Visible commands may verify the hash line and refuse path. They may not award the module result.

## 7. Learning workflow

1. Prepare work folder with prepare_work.py 03.
2. Read the packet.
3. Record the six-concern decision.
4. Inspect raw authority.
5. Hash REL-001 and refuse an outside path.
6. Combine the override prompt with the tool via launcher --hash-tool.
7. Disconnect and revoke (direct and launcher).
8. Leave a handoff.

## 8. Time and cognitive budgets

These are design targets until piloted.

| Item | Budget |
|---|---:|
| Facilitated session | 3 hours |
| Learner operation | 2 hours |
| Packet volume | 40 files |
| Provider calls | 0 required (live lane blocked when key absent) |

## 9. Assessment

Hard gates are in `assessment/PUBLIC_RUBRIC.md`. Class F / human panel remains unmeasured until three people score the prose.

## 10. Failure modes that hold the module

- Unclear rights.
- Unacceptable affected-person effect.
- Missing recourse or disclosure.
- Broad or omitted authority.
- Unknown action or egress.
- Unreviewable approval.
- Unauthorized action or authority expansion.
- Hidden side effect.
- Failed revocation.

## 11. Absolute failures

Report without measurement: timing, effectiveness, cost, or cross-platform operation. Do not claim a human panel that did not sit. Do not present the packet as an authorized dispatch.
